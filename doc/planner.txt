(assumes single-statement query. Does not support subqueries at all)

steps in planning

* get base relations
 	- identify filters for pushdown to planner scan nodes (get_subtrees)
	- identify projections for each scan node

* identify joins

* identify output transforms


======

example plan process



select t1.a , t2.b from A as t1 , B as t2 where t1.a < 3 and t2.b > 5;


1. build scan list
    tables and predicates



=====

thoughts on non-SELECT:

1. First stage split overall text into seperate queries (should be supported from the parse tree stage)
2. plan SELECTs as above

Planner has "plan_select_query" , "plan_update_query" type interface

Subqueries are planned just as queries and their output presented as a relation
