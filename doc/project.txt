Project development notes

Naming convention:

* Functions are named all in lowercase, with underscores separating words. Generally, 
abbreviations aren't used in function names but can be used sparingly to avoid really
long and clumsy function names.

Some example function names:

pt_get_range_table()
parse_query()
process_statement()

* Variables are named using Camel Case. In Erlang, the initial character needs to be uppercase, 
but un C the initial character is lowercase. 

Some Examples (Erlang)

ParentNodeId
CurMaxId
