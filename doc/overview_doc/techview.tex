\section{(anticipated) FAQ}

This sounds like a major challenge. How do you expect to complete such an ambitious project ?

What have you completed so far ?

What time, money and other resources do you have at your disposal ?

Why Erlang + C ?

When will the MVP come out ?

Business model for commercialisation (if any) ?

Are you smarter than Google ? Why hasnâ€™t this been done before ?
